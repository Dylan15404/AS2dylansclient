# dylansclient
This is the web-based client for dylans cpps, solving the problem of Flash ending support in 2020, resulting in obtaining and using Flash harder. This client has many functions, including:
- Automatically clearing the users' cache when the application is launched (parties and features update instantly!)
- Embedded (Pepper) Flash Player. There's no need to install Flash manually.
- Connects to dylansclient cpps server
